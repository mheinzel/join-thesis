  %QUESTION:
  The join-calculus is a
  better distributable
  variant of the pi-calculus,
  with a distributed extension
  featuring explicit locations and migration.
  While
  these properties are promising
  for use in a practical setting,
  the implementation of features such as
  inter-node communication and migration
  is an ambitious effort.
  Therefore, we explore
  the possibility of
  using existing infrastructure of
  actor-based systems.

  %WE DID:
  We develop a
  distributability-preserving
  encoding
  from \corejoincalc
  into \actorpicalc
  (a typed pi-calculus representing the \actormodel)
  and
  use it to derive an implementation
  of \joincalc
  as a thin layer on top of
  the actor-based programming language Erlang.
  Our prototype is then extended
  to support
  the primitives of \distjoincalc
  including migration.
  By using Erlang/OTP as a foundation,
  we obtain a small and simple implementation.

  %RESULTS?
