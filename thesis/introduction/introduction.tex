motivation
pi-calculus not distributable (see exposÃ©)

analysed distributality
  non-local m-pattern (explain?)
showed that join is distributable
reason: locality of channels

important idea: locations
some implementations, but no locations
only jocaml, but modified ...
=> not maintainable
dropped support

more light-weigth approach?
use existing infrastructure!

actors also distributable
=> should be possible to find encoding
   that preserves distributality

based on that, prototype
