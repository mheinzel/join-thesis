\section{Future Work}

After creating a simple prototype for \corejoincalc,
it could be interesting to extend it to the complex definitions
of the full calculus.
Work on compiling these patterns has been done in \cite{maranget_compiling_1998}.
Together with support for synchronous calls and a syntax closer to the calculus
(e.g. using macros or a preprocessor), it would improve usability quite a lot.

An interesting topic to expand on is the failure model of \distjoincalc
\cite{fournet_calculus_1996}, which handles failures on a per-location basis
and allows detecting failure of other locations to recover from it.
This approach seems to fit will with the typical pattern in Erlang of creating a
\emph{supervision tree} of actors responsible for monitoring each other.
