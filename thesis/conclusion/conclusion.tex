as suspected, we were able to find an encoding from joincalc to actorpi
that preserves distributality

did not prove criteria
but can be reasonably sure that it doesn't change the behavior

although the typing rules of APi made the encoding more complex
than many others
it proved to be a good foundation for our prototype
could be translated very directly

when implementing the distributed version
we were able to rely heavily on erlang infrastructure
=>
very light-weight (350 loc)
