As suspected, we were able to find an encoding
from \corejoincalc to \actorpicalc
that preserves distributability.
While we did not formally prove it to be correct,
we showed that the resulting terms can emulate their respective source term
and can be reasonably sure that it does not change its behavior.
Although the typing rules of \actorpicalc made the encoding relatively complex,
it proved to be a good foundation for our prototype
and could be translated very directly into Erlang source code.

When implementing the distributed version,
we were able to heavily rely on Erlang's infrastructure
and create a light-weight prototype in less than 400 lines of code.
