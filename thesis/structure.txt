    motivation
        distributality
            located channels

- preliminaries
    - (pi calculus? only if good flow)
    - join calculus
        - "normal"?
            grammar
            semantics (CHAM)
            (memory cell example?)
        - core join
            can encode normal join
            (encoding example?)
        - locations
            extra syntax
                syntactical rules in definitions
            DRCHAM
            applet example (same as in implementation?)
    - actor model
        definition (Agha)
        properties
        - actor pi
            typing rules enforce properties

- encoding
    - core join to polyadic actor pi
        - a naive approach
            translation as done in pi is not type correct (typing derivation)
            explain problem
        - a more complex approach
            (encoding with divergence?)
            we need to store payloads
            encoding using lists
                type correct (proof with simplified typing derivation)
        - full abstraction
            "join <-> pi" requires firewall context for full abstraction
            (show by example?)
            this is not necessary here (argument, not proof)

- implementation
    - basic encoding from theory
        show correspondence to encoding (code listing)
        no church-encoding necessary, queue for fairness
        examples
    - distributed implementation
        - migrating actors
            cannot move processes directly
            but we create all receiving processes
            => wrapping up and respawning
            how to send to migrated processes?
                global nameserver (gproc/global)
                (temporary forwarders to avoid losing messages)
        - explicit locations
            how are locations represented?
            each node has a root/first-level location
                cannot be moved (see calculus)
            modified def
        - connecting nodes
            finding other locations
            global registration
                no explicit nameserver
            simple distributed examples

- conclusion
    future work
        full join patterns
        synchronous calls
        syntactic sugar
        failure
