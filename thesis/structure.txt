    - pi calculus ?
    - join calculus
        - "normal"
            CHAM
            pi<->join (firewall for full abstraction)
        - core
            can encode whole join
        - locations
            DRCHAM
            extra syntax and rules
            syntactical rules in definitions
    - actor model
    - actor pi
        typing rules enforce actor properties
    - distributality ?
        M

- encoding
    - core join to polyadic actor pi
        no firewall necessary

- implementation
    - basic encoding from theory
    - optimizations
        queue for fairness
        (removing forwarders)
    - distributed implementation

- applications ?
