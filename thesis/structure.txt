    motivation

- preliminaries
    - pi calculus ? (only if good flow)
    - join calculus
        - "normal"
            CHAM
            pi<->join (firewall for full abstraction)
        - core
            can encode whole join
        - locations
            DRCHAM
            extra syntax and rules
            syntactical rules in definitions
    - actor model
        (Agha)
        actor pi
            typing rules enforce actor properties

- encoding
    - core join to polyadic actor pi
        naive encoding is not type correct
        list encoding
            type correct
        no firewall necessary (argument, not proof)

- implementation
    - basic encoding from theory
        queue for fairness
        examples
    - distributed implementation
        wrapping up and respawning
        locations
        distributed examples

- evaluation/comparison

- conclusion
    future work
        non-core calculus
        failure
