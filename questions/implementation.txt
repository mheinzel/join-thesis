erlang
    ??? what is possible regarding cross-node communication?
        ??? how to send a message to a process on another node?
            !!! Pid is global
        ??? can you move the "current process" to another node?
            !!! not a running process, but function with state, respawn
        XXX

fundamentals
    ??? how to represent a channel/name?
        --- Pid of forwarder? (similar to encoding, abstraction)
        --- Pid of common actor + index? (less names to register)
        ??? Pid might change (respawned on different node)
            --- forwarding is inefficient (can create long chain)
            !!! ask registry (e.g. gproc) for every send
        XXX

distribution
    ??? how to send a message to a remote receiver?
        !!! lookup node
            ??? move there (as in theory) or send directly (simpler)?
            XXX
        ??? what if the location just moved to a different machine?
            !!! in the worst case, look it up again, chase it
    ??? how to migrate to a remote location that just moved?
        !!! lookup node of location, move whole own location to node
            ??? how to free/package a location (incl. sublocations)?
                XXX
    ??? which infrastructure is needed?
        !!! name registry (e.g. gproc)
        !!! location registry (location name -> node or pid)
        XXX
    ??? how can we package a location for sending?
        ??? what happens with processes that are still running?
            ??? what happens if we just let them run?
                --- they can do stuff here after the actor started somewhere else already
